  "If you are interested in how the different races in World of Warcraft compare for this build, you can check out the following chart. However, keep in mind that race differences are usually rather small and can change with balance and gameplay changes. You can always play the race you want to play and do not have to feel compelled to choose based on this chart.": "",
  "In order to compare azerite powers with this chart, look for the end of the bars corresponding to the item level of interest. However, you should <0>simulate your own character</0> to find your best setup. These simulations are based on predefined gear sets instead of your own, after all. This means data shown here <1>depends heavily</1> on the used profile with its talents, its gear, etc. and is rather giving an outlook. If your character is different from the setup used here, personal simulations are recommended.": "",

  "Of course, you can also check how the talents compare each other without any azerite power (just unselect all of them). Which is ideal in case you are using only generic azerite powers for example.": "",
  "The fact that generic azerite powers are not included is intended. The goal of such simulations is not to find the best possibilities out of millions possible combinations but rather let you know <0>if a given azerite power alone could impact talents choices</0>. One of the caveat is that it could happen with further stacks or a combination of two of them, those cases are not covered there. You might find more information about such events on your class resources.": "",
  "The purpose of these simulations is to get a general idea of how different setups will compare with each other and not to promote any definitive best builds. Several variables (like different trinkets, WF/TF or ingame situations) are not taken into account. This is why you, as always, should <0><1>simulate your own character</1></0> to find your optimal setup.": "",
